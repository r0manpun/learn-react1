Day 1 
Installation
    npm create vite@latest

Treat Tag as a data
    means we can store tag inside variable
    we can return tag 
    
console
    console will appear in devloper pannel

What will be shown inside browser?
    anythings which is written inside the return statement are printed on the browser

Wrapper 
    Function must return only one wrapper

``
    use ${} inside `` to call a variable
    use ${} inside `` to perform js operation (+, -, *, /, or variable call or function call) 

In react
    use {} inside return statement to call a variable
    we cannot define variable inside {}
    we cannot use (directly) if, else, for, while, do-while inside {}
    but we can use map, filter

Day 2
    array practice, map, filter, reduce

Day 3 
    set in javascript 
    the set item must be of primitive type(null, undefined, string, boolean, number)
    Components
        Make components
        Call components
        Pass value inside component
        Pass Props other than string

    Component :
        it is a function whose first letter is capital and is called like a tag
        <App/>
    Make Components
         Info (it must display name address)    
         College (name, address, affilation)

    props 
        variables which are passed in component
        always use {} to take props
        if props is other than string use {} curly braces

Day 4 
    Behavior of data inside browser 
        boolean are not display in browser
        array are placed one by one

    Rendering Behavior of useState

Day 6
    Make a component named IncrementByChoice
    Make a variable count using useState initialized with 0
    Make a button IncrementBy2 => it must increase the count by 2
    Make a button IncrementBy100 => it must increase the count by 100
    Make a button IncrementBy 1000 => it must increase the count by 1000
    NOTE for all button there must be one handleClick( this can be done by using function that return another function concept)

    Make a component HandleImage
    image must always be inside public folder
